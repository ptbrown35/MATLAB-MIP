* Video Next week
- MATLAB download, load up the script, run the model, Balance!
* Interrupt diven still TBD
- Develop it eventually
- Get balancing first with SLC to share with BBBlue community
* Working on changes to wrap into 2018a 
- I2C, serial
* ISR
- Not the easy way
- Iterate off an example?
- Audio blocks that have interrupts? They'll send a link.
- Wrap an IMU callback for the ISR
* Keep the calls monthly
- Next month, MATHWORKS is busy in Boston
- Maybe talk before with specific ISR questions, by email first
- Where to put videos that I develop?
* Simulink hardware package
- debian is sudo enabled in the background (i.e. they enable root to run because debian user asks for password permissions)
* Ping James on the servo problem
* Mathworks can't connect via debian?
